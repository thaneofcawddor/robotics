@Students: By Friday March 6, 2020, please edit this README.md file to include a statement that you are here that includes your first name and your Github username (see below). To do this you will need to:
* Create a Github account.
* `git clone` the thaneofcawddor/robotics repository into a folder on your computer. I have a folder called "thaneofcawddor" (my Github username) where I keep all the code I write, making the folder structure match my Github repository structure. Figure out an organization regime that works for you.
* Make your edits to the correct README.md file (this one). Save the file.
* Add the modified file to the staging area. Remember, at any time you can type `git status` to see the status of your edits. `git status` does not edit anything, so you can always call it without fear of changing status. I recommend you use `git status` after every step to understand what is happening in the background.
* Once your files are staged, make the commit. Don't forget to include a commit message: `$: .... -m "Short comment in here on what is being committed."` `-m` is what is called a "flag" and it means "-message" and lets the computer know that the string after `-m` should be logged as the commit message. There are usually several flags for any command that let you modify the command. Next time you use `ls` add the `-l` flag (that is a lowercase "L") and see how the list changes.
* This saved the file and its status on your computer, but you also need to update the Github version of this repository and the file it contains that you just changed. `push` the branch of your version (`master`) to the remote repository (`origin`).

Remember, if you edit files right after you `git clone`, you can be pretty sure you have the most recent version of everything. But when you come back to edit anything, you want to pull the most recent version from Github (other students will be changing README.md) of files as well as any new files *before* you start editing. Use `git pull` to update your local branch, then get to coding!
